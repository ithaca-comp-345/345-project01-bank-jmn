Jason - ~~Add userAccount, checkings account, and savings account. Implement getTransactionHistory. Finish use-case diagram.~~ Upload the sequence diagram I already made and make another one that is not getBalance() or getTransactionHistory(). Fix ATM Tests by fixing transaction history property. Add comments. Denote at least one integration and System test.

Nusi - Add the Admin software and the central bank. For central bank, make a hashmap with key value pairs of all of the userAccounts and their accountNumbers as key's

Morgan- add ATM Software Class, Bank Teller Software Class and Implement the methods needed to do Transactions (I had to do this to create userAccount, checkingaccount, and saving account so I think you should do create/delete account or something else - Jason). (I still had to implement some stuff for the ATM things to work and added some getters to yours but I'll do so man, no worries)
