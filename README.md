Jason - Add userAccount, checkings account, and savings account. Implement getTransactionHistory. Finish use-case diagram.

Nusi - Add the Admin software and the central bank. For central bank, make a hashmap with key value pairs of all of the userAccounts and their accountNumbers as key's

Morgan- add ATM Software Class, Bank Teller Software Class and Implement the methods needed to do Transactions (I had to do this to create userAccount, checkingaccount, and saving account so I think you should do create/delete account or something else - Jason). (I still had to implement some stuff for the ATM things to work and added some getters to yours but I'll do so man, no worries)
